Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual runescape account in discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them and trade to other real players.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)


# Skills

You can view your minions' stats using `+m stats`.

## Skillcapes

If you reach level 99 in a skill, you can purchase a skillcape for 99k by typing `+skillcape <skill_name>`. If it's your first 99, you'll get an untrimmed cape.

## Mining

You can train mining using `+mine [quantity] <ore>`, for example `+mine 10 coal`.

### Ores

| Ore Name | Nuggets | Minerals | Level |

# Bank Backgrounds

If you meet the requirements and costs of a background, you can get it using `+bankbg <name>`. The image will replace the background of your bank. Bank backgrounds may require some, or all of these: having items in your collection log, paying GP or sacrificing items. They are meant to be very hard to obtain.

| Name | GP Cost | Item Cost | Collection Log Items Needed |
| - | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Default | 0  |   |  |
| Bandos | 100m | The 4 Godsword Hilts | Entire GWD Collection Log excluding pets, + Bandos pet |
| Corporeal Beast | 100m  |   | Entire Corporeal Beast log including pet |
| Lumbridge (\*) | 100m  |   |  |

Note: the Lumbridge background is only available to T3 patrons, who are still required to pay 100m for it.
