  
Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual runescape account in discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them and trade to other real players.

You can also read the [FAQ](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/faq) for answers to common questions.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)

# Bank Backgrounds

If you meet the requirements and costs of a background, you can get it using `+bankbg <name>`. The image will replace the background of your bank. Bank backgrounds require that you pay GP, items and having certain items in your collection log, they are quite hard to obtain.

Click on the bank bg name to see what it looks like.

# Minion Icons

You can sacrifice items, and their GP value will go towards you unlocking new minion icons. You will automatically receive the icon immediately after sacrificing enough GP. You can see a leaderboard of who has sacrificed the most using `+lb sacrifice`.

You can sacrifice items using `+sacrifice [quantity] <item>`, like `+sacrifice Bandos chestplate` or `+sacrifice 1000 gold ore`. You cannot sacrifice GP.
