# This document is WIP 
It is intended to outline the key differences between BSO and OSB, but may be out of date from recent updates. If you have a question not covered within, please feel free to ask in the support server.

# BSO
Bot School Old, also known as BSO, is a fun, alterantive version of the Old School Bot. It has fun changes, new bosses, custom pets, and more! BSO is completely separate to OSB, and nothing you do in BSO will impact your real minion in OSB. 

## Key Mechanics Changes
- Clue scrolls are stackable
- 5x XP gain
- No 200m cap on XP, and QP is capped at 5000
- 2x PvM speed
- Clue caskets give extra loot
- There are special, custom items, like Mystery boxes and BSO pets
- Certain commands are limited to T5 patrons when outside the support server to prevent botting and alts.
- Everything is tradeable, and there are no ironmen*

*If you have an ironman alt on OSB you can use it to play on BSO, but you cannot have your two BSO account interact in any way whatsoever. 

## BSO Items
Some items are unique to BSO due to custom bosses, mechanic changes, and drop table changes. These can be extremely useful for everything from PvM to Skilling, and are often very rare drops. 

- Mystery Boxes: There are four types of mystery box; **Tradeables, Untradeables, Holiday, and Pet**. Each box has one roll when opened to provide any item of their respective categories that exists or has existed in OSRS. For example, a Tradeables Mystery Box, or TMB for short, can provide you with everything from a raw shripms to a 3rd age pickaxe. Mystery boxes can be obtained from dailies and any activities, and when you obtain one from a PvM or skilling trip, you will have your loot from that trip doubled. For those people who take the time to test new features and find bugs prior to release, there may even be a special box as a reward, so make sure to `.roles tester` in the support server's #other-bots channel to be pinged when testing is live. The only items which cannot drop from these boxes are certain bso exclusives in order to preserve their rarity.

- Dwarven Equipment: Dwarven items are BSO-exclusive boost items. They are either smithed out of dwarven bars (which in turn are smithed out of dwarven ore dropped from dwarven crates) or dropped from the Dwarven King Goldemar. The **Dwarven Greataxe** provides a 2x speed boost to woodcutting and Wintertodt. The **Dwarven Pickaxe** provides a 2x speed boost to mining. The **Dwarven Greathammer** provides a speed 2x boost to smithing and crafting. **Dwarven Gauntlets** provide a 2x speed boost to smelting and a 3x speed boost to cooking. The **Dwarven Warhammer**, which is only dropped from the King, provides a 40% speed boost to all PvM activities. 

- Abyssal Equipment: Abyssal items are BSO-exclusive boost items which are dropped or have component drops from Malygos, the Abyssal Dragon. The **Abyssal Cape** provides a 50% food consumption reduction against any bosses which require food. **Abyssal Dragon Bones** provide 5x more xp than Superior Dragon Bones, the next best prayer method. The **Abyssal Pouch** is created using a Giant Pouch and **Abyssal Thread**, and it provides a significant boost to your speed runecrafting.

- XP Lamps:
Dailies can provide you with XP **lamps** (tiny, small, average, large, and huge) which can be placed in most skills after a short time has passed from the point of their release. These provide 20k, 50k, 100k, 1m, and 5m xp respectively. They are very rare so be careful you spend them on the skill you want boosted using `=lamp size lamp, skill`.

- Misc:
There are a couple of items which don’t fit well into the categories above. The **Fish Sack** drops from the Sea Kraken custom boss and provides a +9 minute base fishing trip time, allowing you to be more afk while fishing. The **Thieves’ Armband** is obtained while training Thieving with the custom Wilvus pet equipped, and it halves your chance to fail a pickpocket attempt. The **Divine Sigil** is a unique drop from Corp which shares the stats of the Elysian, but does not have a food reducing effect, and may be buffed in the future. 


## BSO Monsters
Some monsters and their drops are unique to BSO, and some mobs have had their drop tables slightly modified. 

- King Goldemar, The Dwarven King:
King Goldemar is a group-only boss which drops the Dwarven Warhammer as well as the base materials for the smithable dwarven gear pieces. It requires crush attack and defence gear in the melee setup, and other drops are not of particular note. 

- Sea Kraken, Farmer's Bane:
The Sea Kraken is a solo boss which is useful for its standard drop table which has a lot of food items and seeds, proving useful for those seeking to train farming or cooking, or do PvM. It requires range attack and magic defence gear in your range setup. It also drops the fish sack which boosts fishing, and kraken tentacles which are currently useless but will be useful in the future as slayer is implemented.

- Malygos, the Abyssal Dragon:
Malygos is a solo boss which has a good standard drop table and some powerful rare drops. It requires 999 qp kill and an anti dragon shield or an abyssal cape. It drops all visages, the dragon hunter lance, a unique pet, and other unique items useful for PvM and skilling. 

- Koschei the Deathless, the Immortal Warrior:
сидеть

- The Chambers of Xeric, Raids 1:
While CoX will come to OSB eventually, at the moment it is a BSO exclusive. Equip your best gear (as outlined on the [OSRS wiki CoX strategies page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Chambers_of_Xeric/Strategies) and join up with others for some great loot. You must get 200 kc before you can solo raids as your minion needs expeirence. Notable drops include the twisted bow and the olmlet pet.
