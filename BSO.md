## BSO Pets

- Obis: get from runecrafting, gives random runes on any non-pvm trip
- Peky: get from woodcutting, gives random seeds on any non-pvm trip
- Brock: get from pvm zulrah, gives random logs on any non-pvm trip
- Wilvus: get from farming, gives pre-made pickpocket loot on any non-pvm trip (including chance of thieves armband which halves the chance of failing pickpocketing)
- Plopper: get from farming, makes it so your crops cant die ever (and adding another farming-related perk to it later)
- Smokey (christmas exclusive): extra 1 in 15 chance of mystery box roll in any non-pvm trip, 10% chance of extra mystery box roll
